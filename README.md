# QAProject_Javascript_HTML

Why are we doing this?
This code has been created to design and make a webpage. The web page has the following functions:
It allows user to display existing employee records in a table;
It allows the user to filter the records by department;
It allows the user to add a new employee record;
It allows the user to edit existing records;
It allows the user to delete records;

How I expected the challenge to go?
I expected that I would enjoy the challenge. This is because it has a visual element and allowed me to be creative with the design and layout of the web page. 
I liked to use the different programming languages and the ability to link them together to produce on web page. 
I liked to use JavaScript to write the logic and use HTML and CSS to create the visual elements.

What went well?
The CSS and HTML were the areas of the challenge that went well for me. I enjoyed learning and manipulating the design and layout of the webpage.

What didnâ€™t go as planned?
Some of the logic and functions did not goes as planned. I understood the concept and what I wanted to achieve but lacked in experience in knowing which syntax and logic to use.
I worked to reduce my code and make it cleaner. 

Possible improvement for the future
I feel that my code could be cleaned up further. Such as improving the logic behind the functions. Reducing the amount of code needed to ensure the functions still work. 
The design and layout of the table could be improved and I think the web page could be made to be more user friendly overall.
